# HRP 203 Assignment 4

- a. raw data (cohort simulated data from Assignment #2, named cohort.csv)
- b. Manuscript file (Quarto file named index.qmd)
- c. reference file in bib format  

Packages I used in the analysis included:

I attest that I did not use generative artificial intelligence technology to complete any portion of the work.
