               disease of medium-sized and large arteries fuelled by lipids.
               Endothelial cells, leukocytes, and intimal smooth muscle cells
               are the major players in the development of this disease. The
               most devastating consequences of atherosclerosis, such as heart
               attack and stroke, are caused by superimposed thrombosis.
               Therefore, the vital question is not why atherosclerosis
               develops but rather why atherosclerosis, after years of indolent
               growth, suddenly becomes complicated with luminal thrombosis. If
               thrombosis-prone plaques could be detected and thrombosis
               averted, atherosclerosis would be a much more benign disease.
               Approximately 76\% of all fatal coronary thrombi are
               precipitated by plaque rupture. Plaque rupture is a more
               frequent cause of coronary thrombosis in men (approximately
               80\%) than in women (approximately 60\%). Ruptured plaques are
               characterized by a large lipid-rich core, a thin fibrous cap
               that contains few smooth muscle cells and many macrophages,
               angiogenesis, adventitial inflammation, and outward remodeling.
               Plaque rupture is the most common cause of coronary thrombosis.
               Ruptured plaques and, by inference, rupture-prone plaques have
               characteristic pathoanatomical features that might be useful for
               their detection in vivo by imaging. This article describes the
               pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, how it begets thrombosis, and
               the possibility to detect thrombosis-prone plaques and prevent
               heart attack.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is markedly more common
               in men than in women. In both sexes, CHD risk increases with
               age, but the increase is sharper in women. We analyzed the
               extent to which major cardiovascular risk factors can explain
               the sex difference and the age-related increase in CHD risk.
               METHODS AND RESULTS: The study cohort consists of 14 786 Finnish
               men and women 25 to 64 years old at baseline. The following
               cardiovascular risk factors were determined: smoking, serum
               total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass
               index, and diabetes. Risk factor measurements were done in 1982
               or 1987, and the cohorts were followed up until the end of 1994.
               The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the
               relation between risk factors and CHD risk. CHD incidence in men
               compared with women was approximately 3 times higher and
               mortality was approximately 5 times higher. Most of the risk
               factors were more favorable in women, but the sex difference in
               risk factor levels diminished with increasing age. Differences
               in risk factors between sexes, particularly in HDL cholesterol
               and smoking, explained nearly half of the difference in CHD risk
               between men and women. Differences in serum total cholesterol
               level, blood pressure, body mass index, and diabetes prevalence
               explained about one-third of the age-related increase in CHD
               risk among men and 50\% to 60\% among women. CONCLUSIONS:
               Differences in major cardiovascular risk factors explained a
               substantial part of the sex difference in CHD risk. An increase
               in risk factor levels was associated with the age-related
               increase in CHD incidence and mortality in both sexes but to a
               larger extent in women.",

  abstract  = "Cigarette smoking (CS) continues to be a major health hazard,
               and it contributes significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and
               mortality. Cigarette smoking impacts all phases of
               atherosclerosis from endothelial dysfunction to acute clinical
               events, the latter being largely thrombotic. Both active and
               passive (environmental) cigarette smoke exposure predispose to
               cardiovascular events. Whether there is a distinct direct
               dose-dependent correlation between cigarette smoke exposure and
               risk is debatable, as some recent experimental clinical studies
               have shown a non-linear relation to cigarette smoke exposure.
               The exact toxic components of cigarette smoke and the mechanisms
               involved in CS-related cardiovascular dysfunction are largely
               unknown, but CS increases inflammation, thrombosis, and
               oxidation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Recent
               experimental and clinical data support the hypothesis that
               cigarette smoke exposure increases oxidative stress as a
               potential mechanism for initiating cardiovascular dysfunction.",

               cost to healthcare systems. This study aimed to evaluate the
               costs associated with inpatient hospitalization. METHODS:
               Patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure during a
               hospital admission between 2010 and 2014 in the U.S. Nationwide
               Readmission Database were included. The primary outcome was
               total cost defined by direct cost of index admission and first
               readmission within 30-days. RESULTS: A total of 2,645,336
               patients with primary heart failure were included in the
               analysis. The mean $\pm$ SD total cost overall was $13,807 \pm
               24,145; with mean total costs of $15,618 $\pm$ 25,264 for
               patients with 30-day readmission and $11,845 \pm 22,710 for
               patients without a readmission. The comorbidities strongly
               associated with increased cost were pulmonary circulatory
               disorder (OR 26.24 95\% CI 20.06-34.33), valvular heart disease
               (OR 25.42 95\% CI 20.65-31.28) and bleeding (OR 5.96 95\% CI
               5.47-6.50). Among hospitalized patients, 12.6\% underwent an
               invasive diagnostic procedure or treatment. The mean cost for
               patients without invasive care was $10,995. This increased by
               $129,547, $119,769, $251,110 and $293,575 for receipt of
               circulatory support, intra-aortic balloon pump, LV assist device
               and heart transplant. The greatest mean additional cost annually
               was associated with receipt of coronary angiogram ($26,282 per
               person for a total of ($728.5 million) and mechanical
               ventilation ($54,529 per person for a total of $501.7 million).

               heart failure care are significant, and the major contributors
